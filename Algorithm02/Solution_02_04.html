    <!-- scoring

   An OX problem is a problem in which the answer is either correct or incorrect. built from multiple OX problems
   In order to give additional points to consecutively correct answers in the test, the score is calculated as follows:
   was made If question 1 is correct, it counts as 1 point. The answer to the previous question is incorrect
   The first question answered correctly counts as 1 point. Also, if the answer to the question in a row is correct,
   the second
   Each question is worth 2 points, the third question is worth 3 points, ..., the Kth question is worth K points.
   Incorrect questions count as 0 points
   mountain

   For example, as shown below, if the answer is correct in 10 OX questions, it is marked as 1, and if it is incorrect,
   When it is marked as 0 in the right, the score calculation is calculated as shown in the table below, and the total score is

   1+1+2+3+1+2 = 10 points.

   1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0

   Scoring  [1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0]
   Score    [1 0 1 2 3 0 0 1 2 0]

   Write a program that calculates the total score given the graded results of test questions.

   ▣ Input description
   The number of problems N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) is given in the first line. The second line shows the scoring results of N questions.
   The expression is given with a blank space between 0 and 1. 0 is the answer to the question is incorrect, 1 is the answer to the question
   if the answer is correct

   ▣ Output Description
   The first line outputs the total score considering the additional points for the scoring results given in the input.

   ▣ Input Example 1
   10
   1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0

   ▣ Output example 1
   10 -->

        for (let i = 0; i < input; i++) {
          if (answer[i] === 1) {
            conRightAnswer++; //if the output is 6 the score is increament, if the conRightAnswer is increament the output is 10.
            score += conRightAnswer;
          } else {
            conRightAnswer = 0;
          }
        }
        return score;
