   do. If the same score is entered, it is treated the same with a higher rank. That is, the highest score is 92 points.
   If there are 3 students with 92 points, 3 students will be in first place, and the next student will be in 4th place.

   ▣ Output example 1
   4 3 2 1 5 -->
    <script>
      function getRank(input, scores) {
        const sortScores = [...scores].sort((a, b) => b - a); //Same as .sort(funtion(a,b){return a-b;});
        const rank = [];
        for (let i = 0; i < input; i++) {
          const ranks = sortScores.indexOf(scores[i]) + 1;
          rank.push(ranks);
        }
        return rank.join(' ');
      }
      const input = 5;
      const scores = [87, 89, 92, 100, 76];
      console.log(getRank(input, scores)); //the output is (2 3 4 5 1)
