    <!--peak

  Map information is given on an N*N grid. Each grid is marked with the height of that region. each grid
  The number on the board that is greater than your top, bottom, left, and right numbers is the peak area.
  How many peak areas Write a program to find out if
  Assume that the edges of the grid are initialized to 0.
  If N=5 and the number of grids is as follows, the number of peaks is 10.

  0 0 0 0 0 0 0
  0 5 3 7 2 3 0
  0 3 7 1 6 1 0
  0 7 2 5 3 4 0
  0 4 3 6 4 1 0
  0 8 7 3 5 2 0

  ▣ Input description
  A natural number N is given in the first line. (1<=N<=50)
  From the second line to the N lines, N natural numbers are given in each line. Each natural number does not exceed 100
  all.

  ▣ Input description
