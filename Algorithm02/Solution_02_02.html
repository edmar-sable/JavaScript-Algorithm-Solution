   given in order from west to west
   write ram (It is visible if it is larger than the people standing in front of it, and invisible
   if it is smaller or equal to it.)

   ▣ Input description
   An integer N is entered on the first line. In the next line, the heights of N students are given
   in order from the front.

   ▣ Output Description
   Displays the maximum number of students the teacher can see.

   ▣ Input Example 1
   8
   130 135 148 140 145 150 150 153

   ▣ Output example 1

        for (let i = 0; i < input; i++) {
          const height = heights[i];
          if (height > maxHeight) {
