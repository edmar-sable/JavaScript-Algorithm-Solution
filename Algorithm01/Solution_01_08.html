  seven dwarfs
  A crisis came to Snow White, who was living a peaceful life with the seven dwarfs, avoiding the queen.
  There were nine dwarves, not seven, who returned from work.
  All nine dwarfs claimed to be the protagonists of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs." excellent
  Snow White, who had mathematical intuition, fortunately realized that the sum of the heights of
  the seven dwarfs was 100.
  I remembered.
  Given the height of the nine dwarfs, help Snow White write a program to find the seven dwarfs.
  oh.

  ▣ Input description
  The heights of the dwarves are given over nine lines. The given key is a natural number not exceeding 100,
  All nine dwarfs have different heights, and if there are several possible answers, any one is output.

  ▣ Output Description
  Outputs the heights of the seven dwarves in the order entered.

  ▣ Input Example 1
  20 7 23 19 10 15 25 8 13

  ▣ Output example 1
  20 7 23 19 10 8 13
