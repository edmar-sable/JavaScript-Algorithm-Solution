  Algorithm 6

  odd number 
   
  Given 7 natural numbers,  
  select all odd natural numbers among them and find their sum,  
  and select the odd numbers 
  Write a program to find the minimum of 
   
  For example, given the seven natural numbers  
  12, 77, 38, 41, 53, 92, and 85, the odd ones are 77, 41, 53, 
  85, so the sum is 
  77 + 41 + 53 + 85 = 256 
  becomes, 
  41 < 53 < 77 < 85 
  Therefore, the smallest of the odd numbers is 41. 
   
  ▣ Input description 
  The first line contains 7 natural numbers.  
  The given natural number is less than 100. more than one odd number 
  must exist 
   
  ▣ Output Description 
  The sum of the odd numbers is printed on the first line,  
  and the minimum of the odd numbers is printed on the second line. 
   
  ▣ Input Example 1 
  12 77 38 41 53 92 85 
  ▣ Output example 1 
  256 
  41
